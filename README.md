# Hey, I’m Patrick!  
**Tech With Thisguy**

I’m a software development student and small-business tech builder based in Florida, focused on creating practical, real-world tools that actually get used.

I enjoy building things that solve everyday problems for service businesses — websites, internal tools, lead systems, and automation — and continuously improving them as I learn more.

I’m not chasing hype tech. I’m focused on **useful, maintainable solutions** and steady growth as a developer.

## What I’m Working Toward

My long-term goal is to grow **Tech With Thisguy LLC** into a reliable software and web solutions business for small companies — especially local service-based businesses that need better systems but don’t need bloated enterprise software.

That means:
- building clean, understandable software
- improving user experience for non-technical users
- learning how real systems behave in production
- getting better every project, every repo

## How I Think About Development

I value:
- clean, readable code
- solving real problems

- building things that can evolve over time

I’m not afraid to start simple and iterate.
